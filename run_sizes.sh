# Model-size experiment: BERT mini, med and baseline on lanl14argus, static walks, fine-tuned and
# evaluated at walk length 4 only, five pretraining seeds each, everything on the h100 queue.
# The tiny model is the main runs (results/lp-static/lanl14argus/lp_ps*_tiny_wl4_*), so it is
# not rerun here.
#
# This drives run_all_hpc.sh once per size, so it inherits its rules: one bsub job per cell,
# fine-tunes chained to their pretraining with ended(), existing checkpoints / finished CSVs
# skipped, --force to redo. Names carry the size, so nothing overlaps the tiny runs:
#   checkpoints  pretrained/static/lanl14argus/rw_bert_lanl14argus_ps1_<size>.pt
#   results      results/lp-static/lanl14argus/lp_ps1_<size>_wl4_ps1_s0.csv
#   job logs     logs/size-<size>/pt_static_lanl14argus_<size>_ps1.{sh,out}, ft_..._wl4.{sh,out}
#
#   ./run_sizes.sh --dry-run          # check the bsub commands first
#   ./run_sizes.sh                    # 3 sizes x 5 seeds = 15 pretrainings + 15 fine-tunes
#   SIZES="baseline" ./run_sizes.sh   # one size only
#   WALL_PT=49:00 ./run_sizes.sh      # the h100 maximum (RUNLIMIT 2940 min)
#
